# Introduction 
This is the child theme template that is provided on a new site build.
As per standard WordPress practices, any edits should be made here in the child theme instead of in the parent theme.
Any updates to the parent will override changes made there.

# Getting Started
1.	Installation process
    Just clone and deploy into the `wp-content/themes` directory of a WordPress site install. It requires the Alpha theme to be installed as well
